<p>I recently graduated with my Bachelor's from SUNY Albany, where I majored in psychology and minored in business.
I've volunteered in 3 different psychology research labs and that's where I first got 
exposed to a programming language (Python). I moved to Austin about a year ago to seek new opportunities and steady my 
career path. Sure enough, I came across The Coding Bootcamp at UT, where I've been pushing my capabilities and learning 
to code from a full stack prespective. Since starting, I've learned how to follow a MVC model, create a RESTful API, 
create an object oriented program, collaborate on GitHub, run browser tests, picked up many new languages and libraries 
such as React.js, and much more. I've become passionate about making creative web applications and solving complex problems with 
elegant yet easily maintainable code.
