<p>I recently graduated with my Bachelor's from SUNY Albany, where I majored in psychology and minored in business.
I've volunteered in 3 different psychology research labs (social, neuro, and cognitive) and that's where I first got 
exposed to a programming language (Python). I moved to Austin about a year ago to seek new opportunities and steady my 
career path. Sure enough, I came across The Coding Bootcamp at UT, where I've been pushing my capabilities and learning 
to code from a full stack prespective. Since starting, I've learned how to follow an MVC model, create a RESTful API, 
create an object oriented program, collaborate on GitHub, run node tests, and picked up many languages and libraries. 
Check out my portfolio for some of my latest work.
