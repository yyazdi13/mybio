<p>I recently graduated with my Bachelor's from SUNY Albany, where I majored in psychology and minored in business.
    I've volunteered in 3 different psychology research labs (social, neuro, and cognitive) and that's where I've first gotten exposed to coding programs like Python.
I moved to Austin about a year ago to seek new opportunities and steady my career path. Sure enough, I came across The Coding Bootcamp at UT, where I've been learning all about full stack development.
What I love most about the program is the feeling of empowerment that comes with being able to create and design your own content from scratch. As I continue my journey through this program, I will look forward to learning the skills to be able to create content for other people.
